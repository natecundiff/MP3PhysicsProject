# Physics Coding Project for MP3
Trinket GlowScript simulation: https://physics.natecundiff.com/simulations/mp3codingproject/
## About
This is a GlowScript simulation of a double pendulum made from springs. It consists of two overlapping pendulums, one traced in blue, the other in red. The springs in the red pendulum are 0.1% larger than the springs in the blue pendulum. The simulation demonstrates the concept of entropy and how a very small difference between two systems is amplified over time.

## Credits
I had a friend help me with the trigonometry that is required to calculate the position of the first and second nodes based on the forces applied to them.
